Two complex numbers $z = x+iy$ and $w=u+iv$ are equal if both $x=u$ and $y=v$. If $u\ne x$ and $v\ne y$, or both, then z and w are not equal.
So for two complex numbers to be equal, the real parts must be equal and the imaginary parts must be equal. When we use this result we say that we are equating real and imaginary parts.
Equating real and imaginary parts is a very useful method which often yields 'two for the price of one' when working with complex numbers.

**To find the reciprocal of a complex number you multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator**

$$\text{By writing }\frac{1}{x+iy} = p+iq$$
$$\text{show that }\frac{1}{x+iy}=\frac{x-iy}{x^2+y^2}$$
$$\downarrow$$
$$\frac{1}{x+iy} * \frac{x-iy}{x-iy} \left. \right\} = 1$$

### Example
$$\text{Express } \frac{9-4i}{2+3i}\text{ as a complex number in the form }x+iy$$
$$\frac{9-4i}{2+3i}*\frac{2-3i}{2-3i}$$
$$\frac{(9-4i)(2-3i)}{13}$$
$$\frac{18 - 27i - 8i -12}{13}$$
$$\frac{6-35i}{13}$$
$$=\frac{6}{13} - \frac{35}{13}i$$
