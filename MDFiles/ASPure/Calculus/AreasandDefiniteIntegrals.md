$$\int 2x\ dx = \frac{2x^2}2 + c$$
$$\int_{1}^{4}2x\ dx = [\frac{2x^2}2 + c]^4_1$$
$$(\frac{2(4)^2}2 + c) - (\frac{2(1)^2}2 + c)$$
$$16 + c -1 -c$$
$$ = 15$$

**Area above y = 0 and area bellow the line y = 0 will cancel. If a graph has area both above and below, you have to split your working into 2 parts and flip the sign for the negative solution to add it to the total area.**
______
#### Example
$$\int_{1}^{\infty} x^{-2}\ dx$$
$$\int_{1}^{\infty} x^{-2}\ dx = \frac{x^-1}{-1} = -\frac{1}{x} = 
[-\frac{1}{x}]^{\infty}_{1}$$
$$ = (-\frac{1}{\infty}) - (-\frac{1}1)$$
_Anything divided by infinity tends to zero because the fraction becomes so small_
$$=0 + 1$$
$$= 1$$
_______
#### Example
Find the area between the curve $y = 2\sqrt{x} + 1$, the y-axis and the lines y = 3 and y = 5.

Option 1:
Make y the subject of the equation.

$$ (\frac{y-1}2)^2 = x$$
$$\int_{3}^{5} (\frac{y-1}2)^2\ dy = \frac{(\frac{y-1}2)^3}3 * \frac1{\frac12} + c$$
$$\frac{2(\frac{y-1}2)^3}3 + c$$
$$(\frac{2(\frac{5-1}2)^3}3) - (\frac{2(\frac{3-1}2)^3}3)$$
$$ = \frac{14}3$$

Option 2:

Calculate the total area, then remove the area under the curve between (1,0) and (4,0) and then the small black rectangle in the corner.
