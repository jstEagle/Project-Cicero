$$f(x) = x^{-1}(2x^{-2}-\sqrt{x})$$
$$= x^{-1}(2x^{-2}-x^{\frac12})$$
$$= 2x^{-3}-x^{-\frac12}$$
$$=-6x^{-4}+x^{-\frac32}$$
$$=\frac{-6}{x^4}+\frac{1}{x^{\frac32}}$$
$$=\frac{-6}{x^4} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^3}}$$

## Stationary points

### Min & Max

When m = 0. This means that the gradient of the tangent it 0.
Left and right of this tangent, any other tangents drawn are expected to have a non-zero gradient and a change of sign left and right of the turning point is expected.

2 turning points means that the discriminant of the function f'(x) is > 0

1 turning point means that the discriminant of the function f'(x) is = 0

Point of inflection means that the discriminant of the function f'(x) < 0, meaning that the graph f'(x) has non-real roots.

### Points of Inflection

The point of inflection is a change in concavity.


## Method for finding the Nature of the turning points of a graph

Take the second derivative of the function.

Plug in the roots of the first derivative of the function into the second derivative.

A negative solution to the previous step means that the turning point is a maximum.
A positive solution to the previous step means that the turning point is a minimum.

### Increasing = gradient is positive

### Decreasing = gradient is negative


### Example
$$y=2x^3-3x^2$$
$$\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x^2-6x$$
$$6x^2-6x$$
$$=x^2-x$$
$$0 = x(x-1)$$
$$x = 0\ or\ x = 1$$

$$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 12x - 6$$
$$tp - (0,0)\ and\ (1,-1)$$
$$(0,0)-Maximum$$
$$(1,-1)-Minimum$$
