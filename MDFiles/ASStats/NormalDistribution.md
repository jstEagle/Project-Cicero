$p(X > a) = \phi (-a)$

$p(X < a) = \phi (a)$ 

________
### Calculating Z-value

#### $$ z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$
Z - How many standard deviation the desired value is away from the mean.

_______
### Example

In 2014, Americans spent on average 40 minutes per day on social media. If the distribution of these times is normally distributed and the standard deviation is 9.7 minutes:

1) Calculate the probability that an American spends less than 15 minutes a day on social media.

$$p(X < 15) = ?$$
$$z = \frac{15 - 40}{9.7} = -2.577$$
$$ p = 0.005$$

2) Calculate the probability that an American spends between 30 minutes and 40 minutes a day on social media.

$$ 0.5 - p(X < 30) = p(30<X <40)$$
$$z = \frac{30 - 40}{9.7} = -1.031\ (3sf)$$
$$ 1 - (0.5 + \phi(z)) = 0.3487$$

### Actual equation for Normal Distribution

### $$f(x | \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
