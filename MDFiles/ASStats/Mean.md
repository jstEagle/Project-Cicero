Mean = $\frac{650}{20}$ = 32.5

Mean is abstract by nature and will rarely be a whole number.


### Example
The heights x cm, of a group of 28 people is measured. The mean height is found to be 172.6cm
and the standard deviation is found to be $\sigma$ = 4.58cm. A person of height 161.8cm is removed from the group.

Find the mean height of the remaining 27 people:

$$\frac{172.6 * 28 - 161.8}{27} = 173cm$$

**The average of a set multiplied by n is the $\sum x$
