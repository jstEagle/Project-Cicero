The central limit theorem (CLT) states that as the sample size increases, the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution. Mathematically, for a sample mean $\bar{X}$ of size $n$, where $X$ is a random variable, it follows a normal distribution with a mean of $\mu$ (population mean) and a variance of $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$ (population variance divided by sample size). The CLT is illustrated by the example of rolling a fair six-sided die multiple times, where the distribution of sample means becomes more bell-shaped as the number of rolls increases.

### The theorem
For any sequence of independent random variables $\bar{x_1},\bar{x_2},\dots,\bar{x_n}$ with finite mean $\mu$ and non-zero variance $\sigma^2$, then provided $n$ is sufficiently large ($n > 50$), $\bar{x}$ has approximately a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$, where $\bar{x} = \frac{\bar{x_1},\bar{x_2},\dots,\bar{x_n}}{n}$
or in symbols
$$\bar{X} \approx N(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n})$$
