### $$27y^6 + 64x^9 = (3y^2 + 4x^3)(9y^4 - 12x^3y^2 + 16x^6)$$
### $$27y^6 - 64x^9 = (3y^2 - 4x^3)(9y^4 + 12x^3y^2 + 16x^6)$$
### Explained example:
Factorize: $x^3 - 8$
$$(x-?)(x^2+?x+?)$$
The first question mark will be the last part -8 cube rooted because its $x^3$ 
so...
$$(x-2)(x^2+?x+?)$$
-2 and the last question mark have to multiply together to give 8 so the last question mark is $? = 4$
$$(x-2)(x^2+?x+4)$$
And the last question mark has to cancel will the the -2 meaning that it has to be +2
leaving the factorized form to be...
$$(x-2)(x^2+2x+4)$$

#### Another run through
Factorize $x^3 + 9^3$
$$(x+?)(x^2 - ?x + ?)$$
$$\downarrow$$
$$(x+9)(x^2-?x+?)$$
$$\downarrow$$
$$(x+9)(x^2 - ?x + 9^2)$$
$$\downarrow$$
$$(x+9)(x^2-9x+9^2)$$
